# quick-proxy-cli
Just testing the Git flow with C++, nothing to see here lol.
This might be useful as part of an automation tool chain as it's very fast, possible usage:
```python
os.system("quick-proxy-cli.exe "&protocol=http&timeout=9000&country=all&ssl=all&anonymity=all&simplified=true" > my_proxy_list.txt > 2>&1")
```

# Requirements
